                <p><b>A Workshop on Essentials of Data Science</b></p><br><br>
                <p>Hey Data Science enthusiasts</p><br>
                <p>The Data Science Club, VIT Bhopal, organized a successful and informative hands-on
                    workshop on “Essentials of Data Science” on 21st December 2021 virtually, where
                    our resource person Dr. Sudha Subramani, gave a keynote lecture on Data
                    Preprocessing, Data Exploration, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning techniques.</p><br>
                <p>Dr. Sudha Subramani who is currently a Lecturer in Information Technology
                    Discipline, Victoria University, Melbourne, Australia, shared her knowledge and deep
                    insights in the workshop. She was awarded a Gold Medal for her academic
                    excellence in her Masters’s in India. Furthermore, she recently received highly
                    competitive Oracle Cloud credits in the recognition of AI research that supports
                    social good. She worked as a data scientist with an organization AIforGood, UK. Her
                    research and data analytics work cover many social topics including the COVID-19.</p><br>
                <p>The hands-on session was beginner-friendly. It started with the basics of setting up
                    the Python Environment, where students installed Python3. They were taught to
                    work on the Jupyter Notebook, which was followed by the introduction of prime
                    libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, etc. Students were provided with the
                    knowledge of loading the Dataset, Data Preprocessing, and Machine Learning
                    Applications.</p><br>
                <p>The Data Science Club is thankful to our esteemed Dr. S. Poonkuntran, Professor and
                    Dean, School of Computing Science and Engineering (SCSE) for organizational
                    support.The workshop was organized by our faculty coordinators Dr. Pon
                    Harshavardhanan and Dr. K. Murugeswari, along with our student coordinators
